/**
 * This file contains helper functions and examples showing how to integrate
 * a more intelligent construction and worker management system into the
 * existing cordex code base.  The goal is to reduce the number of
 * simultaneously open construction sites, better prioritise build tasks
 * based on controller level (RCL) and available energy, spawn an
 * appropriate number of worker creeps per project, and improve energy
 * acquisition for workers.
 *
 * To adopt these changes you should:
 *
 *  - Import the helpers where needed (e.g. in HandleSpawn and Worker
 *    logic).
 *  - Replace simple heuristics with calls to the provided functions.
 *  - Adjust the constants below to suit your own play style.
